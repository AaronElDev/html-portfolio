  I grew up exposed in the internet, gadgets and many technologies, ever since as kid, I've always been
  curious about how websites, applications and softwares are made off, after entering the IT Industry 
  I started to finally get the answer to that question.
</p>

<p>I've always been curious with different softwares and applications, but the one that caught my interest
  the most is probably the Video Editing software, I Remember using the the first editing software I took a liking which was
  the Windows Movies Maker, gave me tons of idea. I even made my first channel and posted my videos there using windows movie maker
  as my video editing software. even after entering high schoool my passions to editing grew bigger, until college that I 
  came across a free software that could provide the same service as what Premier and after effects could provide, which was
  Davinci Resolve, I started getting into editing once more by editing my valorant clips into short montages and 
  posted them on social media like Tiktok.
